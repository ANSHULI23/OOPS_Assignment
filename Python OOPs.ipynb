What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n","\n"," - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" and \"classes\" to design and structure software. It is based on the concept of objects, which can contain both data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. OOP aims to model real-world entities as objects within a program, making it easier to manage and maintain code.\n","\n","###**Key Concepts of OOP:**\n","\n","**1. Classes and Objects:**\n","\n"," - **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods common to all objects of that type.\n","\n"," - **Object:** An instance of a class. It is a specific entity created based on the class blueprint.\n","- Example:\n","\n",">>class Dog:\n","    def init(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name  # Attribute\n","        self.age = age    # Attribute\n","\n","    def bark(self):  # Method\n","        print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n","\n",">>my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)  # Creating an object\n","my_dog.bark()  # Calling a method on the object\n","\n","\n","###**2. Encapsulation:**\n","\n","- The concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).\n","\n","- It also hides the internal state of an object from the outside world, providing controlled access through public methods (getters and setters).\n","\n","  - Example:\n","\n",">>class BankAccount:\n","    def init(self, balance):\n","        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n","\n","    def deposit(self, amount):\n","        if amount > 0:\n","            self.__balance += amount\n","\n","    def get_balance(self):\n","        return self.__balance\n","\n","\n","###**3. Inheritance:**\n","\n","- A mechanism where one class can inherit the attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.\n","\n","  - Example:\n","\n",">>class Animal:\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n","\n",">>class Dog(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Dog barks\")\n","\n",">>dog = Dog()\n","dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks\n","\n","\n","###**4. Polymorphism:**\n","- The ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. It allows using a single interface to represent different types of objects.\n"," - Example:\n","\n",">>class Cat(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Cat meows\")\n","\n",">>animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n","for animal in animals:\n","    animal.speak()  # Output: Dog barks, Cat meows\n","\n","\n","###**5. Abstraction:**\n","\n","- Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary functionality. It simplifies interaction with objects by providing a clear interface.\n","\n"," - Example:\n","\n",">>from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n",">>class Shape(ABC):\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def area(self):\n","        pass\n","\n",">>class Circle(Shape):\n","    def init(self, radius):\n","        self.radius = radius\n","\n","    def area(self):\n","        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2\n","\n","\n","\n","###**Benefits of OOP:**\n","\n"," - **Modularity:** The code is divided into separate classes, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n","\n"," - **Reusability:** You can reuse code via inheritance and create new classes based on existing ones.\n","\n"," - **Scalability:** OOP systems are easier to extend and modify over time.\n","\n"," - **Maintainability:** Changes made to one part of the program can be isolated without affecting other parts.\n","\n","\n","**Conclusion:**\n","\n"," - OOP is widely used because it reflects real-world concepts, making software development more intuitive and organized. By focusing on objects, attributes, and methods, OOP simplifies managing complex systems and allows for more reusable and maintainable code.\n","----\n","###**2. What is a class in OOP?**\n","\n"," - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines a set of properties (also called attributes) and methods (functions or behaviors) that the objects created from the class will have. A class encapsulates data for the object and the methods that operate on the data.\n","\n","  - Example:\n","\n","#### Defining a class 'Car'\n",">class Car:\n","    # Constructor to initialize attributes\n","    def init(self, make, model, year):\n","        self.make = make  # attribute\n","        self.model = model  # attribute\n","        self.year = year  # attribute\n","    \n","    # Method to display car information\n","    def display_info(self):\n","        print(f\"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n","\n","#### Creating objects (instances) of the class Car\n",">car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2020)\n",">car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2022)\n","\n","#### Accessing methods using the objects\n",">car1.display_info()  # Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla\n",">car2.display_info()  # Output: 2022 Honda Civic\n","\n","----\n","###**3. What is an object in OOP?**\n","\n"," - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity or a concept that has both attributes (properties) and methods (functions) to define its behavior.\n","\n"," - **Attributes:** These are the data or properties that describe the object. For example, for a \"Car\" object, attributes could be color, model, and engine type.\n","\n"," - **Methods:** These are the actions or behaviors that the object can perform. For example, a \"Car\" object might have methods like drive() and stop().\n","  - Example in Python:\n","\n","#### Define a class (blueprint) for a Car\n",">class Car:\n","    def init(self, brand, model, color):\n","        self.brand = brand\n","        self.model = model\n","        self.color = color\n","    \n","    def drive(self):\n","        print(f\"The {self.color} {self.brand} {self.model} is now driving.\")\n","    \n","    def stop(self):\n","        print(f\"The {self.color} {self.brand} {self.model} has stopped.\")\n","\n","#### Create an object of the Car class\n",">my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", \"blue\")\n","\n","#### Accessing object attributes\n",">print(my_car.brand)  # Output: Toyota\n","\n","#### Calling object methods\n",">my_car.drive()  # Output: The blue Toyota Camry is now driving.\n",">my_car.stop()   # Output: The blue Toyota Camry has stopped.\n","\n","**Explanation:**\n","\n","- Car is the class, which is like a template.\n","\n","- my_car is an object (instance) of the Car class.\n","\n","- The attributes are brand, model, and color.\n","\n","- The methods are drive() and stop(), defining the behavior of the car.\n","----\n","###**4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**\n","\n"," - Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes.\n","\n","##**Abstraction:**\n","\n","- **Definition:** Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object or system.\n","\n","- **Purpose:** It simplifies the complexity by focusing on the essential aspects and leaving out unnecessary details.\n","\n","- **How it works:** It can be achieved using abstract classes or interfaces in programming.\n","\n"," - **Example:** Consider a Car class. The details about how the engine works or how the fuel system operates are hidden from the user, who only interacts with the methods like start(), stop(), or accelerate().\n","\n",">class Car:\n","    def start(self):\n","        print(\"Car started\")\n","\n","    def stop(self):\n","        print(\"Car stopped\")\n","\n","#### The user only interacts with the start() and stop() methods.\n",">car = Car()\n","car.start()  # No need to know the internal working of the car's engine.\n","\n","##**Encapsulation:**\n","\n"," - **Definition:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n","\n"," - **Purpose:** It helps in protecting the integrity of the data and ensuring that it can only be accessed or modified in well-defined ways.\n","\n"," - **How it works:** This is usually done using access modifiers like private, protected, and public to control access to class variables and methods.\n","\n","   - **Example:** Consider the same Car class but now with private variables. The fuel level is private and can only be accessed or modified through methods.\n","\n",">>class Car:\n","    def init(self):\n","        self.__fuel_level = 100  # Private variable\n","\n","    def get_fuel_level(self):\n","        return self.__fuel_level\n","\n","    def set_fuel_level(self, fuel):\n","        if 0 <= fuel <= 100:\n","            self.__fuel_level = fuel\n","        else:\n","            print(\"Invalid fuel level\")\n","\n",">>car = Car()\n","print(car.get_fuel_level())  # Access through method\n","car.set_fuel_level(80)  # Modify using setter method\n","\n","**Key Differences:**\n","\n","    1. Abstraction hides the complexity of the system by exposing only the necessary functionality. Encapsulation hides the internal state of the object and only allows modification through well-defined methods.\n","    \n","    2. Abstraction is about what operations can be performed, while encapsulation is about how data is protected and accessed.\n","    \n","    3. Abstraction is typically achieved through abstract classes or interfaces. Encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers (private, protected, public).\n","----\n","###**5. What are dunder methods in Python?**\n","\n"," - Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore methods,\" are special methods in Python that have names starting and ending with double underscores (e.g., init, str, add). These methods enable customization of the behavior of Python objects and are often used to implement operator overloading, object initialization, and more.\n","\n","  - Common Dunder Methods and Examples\n","\n","**1. init (Constructor)**\n"," - Used to initialize an object when it is created.\n","\n",">class Person:\n","    def init(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.age = age\n","p = Person(\"Anshuli\", 25)\n","print(p.name)  # Output: Anshuli\n","\n","\n","**2. str (String Representation)**\n"," - Defines how an object is represented as a string.\n","\n",">class Person:\n","    def init(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.age = age\n","    def str(self):\n","        return f\"{self.name}, {self.age} years old\"\n","p = Person(\"Anshuli\", 25)\n","print(p)  # Output: Anshuli, 25 years old\n","\n","\n","**3. add (Operator Overloading)**\n"," - Allows custom behavior for the + operator.\n","\n",">class Number:\n","    def init(self, value):\n","        self.value = value\n","    def add(self, other):\n","        return Number(self.value + other.value)\n","n1 = Number(5)\n","n2 = Number(10)\n","n3 = n1 + n2\n","print(n3.value)  # Output: 15\n","\n","**4. len (Length of Object)**\n"," - Customizes the behavior of len() for an object.\n","\n",">>class CustomList:\n","    def init(self, items):\n","        self.items = items\n","    def len(self):\n","        return len(self.items)\n","cl = CustomList([1, 2, 3, 4])\n","print(len(cl))  # Output: 4\n","\n","\n","**5. getitem and setitem (Index Access)**\n"," - Customize item access and assignment.\n","\n",">class CustomList:\n","    def init(self, items):\n","        self.items = items\n","    def getitem(self, index):\n","        return self.items[index]\n","    def setitem(self, index, value):\n","        self.items[index] = value\n","cl = CustomList([1, 2, 3])\n","print(cl[1])  # Output: 2\n","cl[1] = 10\n","print(cl[1])  # Output: 10\n","\n","\n","**6. eq (Equality Comparison)**\n"," - Defines behavior for the == operator.\n","\n",">class Person:\n","    def init(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.age = age\n","    def eq(self, other):\n","        return self.name == other.name and self.age == other.age\n","p1 = Person(\"Anshuli\", 25)\n","p2 = Person(\"Anshuli\", 25)\n","print(p1 == p2)  # Output: True\n","\n","\n","**7. call (Callable Objects)**\n"," - Makes an instance callable like a function.\n","\n",">class Greeter:\n","    def init(self, name):\n","        self.name = name\n","    def call(self):\n","        return f\"Hello, {self.name}!\"\n","g = Greeter(\"Anshuli\")\n","print(g())  # Output: Hello, Anshuli!\n","\n","\n","##**Why Use Dunder Methods?**\n","\n","- Dunder methods make Python objects more intuitive and enable you to customize behavior in a Pythonic way. They are used for:\n","\n"," - Operator overloading (+, -, *, etc.)\n","\n"," - Object initialization\n","\n"," - Object representation\n","\n"," - Comparisons (==, <, etc.)\n","\n"," - Iteration and slicing\n","\n"," - Custom callable objects\n","\n","###They enhance the functionality and readability of custom classes in Python.\n","----\n","###**6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.**\n","\n","- Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept where one class (called a child class or subclass) derives or inherits properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from another class (called a parent class or superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.\n","\n","**Key Points about Inheritance:**\n","\n","1. **Code Reusability:** Common code in the parent class can be reused by child classes, reducing redundancy.\n","\n","\n","2. **Parent-Child Relationship:** The child class inherits all non-private members (fields and methods) of the parent class.\n","\n","\n","3. **Extensibility:** The child class can override or extend the functionality of the parent class.\n","\n","\n","4. **Single and Multiple Inheritance:**\n","\n","  - Single Inheritance: A class inherits from one parent class.\n","\n","  - Multiple Inheritance (not supported directly in Java but achieved using interfaces): A class inherits from multiple parent classes.\n","\n","\n","**Syntax Example in Python:**\n","\n",">class Parent:\n","    def greet(self):\n","        print(\"Hello from the Parent class!\")\n","\n",">class Child(Parent):  # Child inherits from Parent\n","    def greet(self):  # Method overriding\n","        print(\"Hello from the Child class!\")\n","\n","### Usage\n",">obj = Child()\n","obj.greet()  # Output: Hello from the Child class!\n","\n","##**Types of Inheritance:**\n","\n","1. **Single Inheritance:** A class inherits from one parent class.\n","\n","\n","2. **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits from a child class, forming a chain.\n","\n","\n","3. **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.\n","\n","\n","4. **Multiple Inheritance:** A class inherits from more than one class (supported in Python but not directly in Java).\n","\n","\n","5. **Hybrid Inheritance:** A combination of two or more types of inheritance.\n","\n","\n","**Advantages:**\n","\n","- Encourages modularity and reusability.\n","\n","- Helps maintain the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n","\n","- Facilitates polymorphism by allowing method overriding.\n","\n","\n","**Disadvantages:**\n","\n","- Can lead to tight coupling between parent and child classes.\n","\n","- Multiple inheritance (in some languages) may introduce ambiguity (e.g., the Diamond Problem).\n","----\n","###**7. What is polymorphism in OOP?**\n","\n","- Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the ability of a single interface or function to operate on different types of data or objects. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling a single piece of code to handle various data types and class structures.\n","\n","**Types of Polymorphism:**\n","\n","1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding):**\n","\n"," - Achieved through method overloading or operator overloading.\n","\n"," - The decision of which method or operator to invoke is made at compile time.\n","\n","  - **Example (Method Overloading in Java):**\n","\n","class Calculator {\n","    int add(int a, int b) {\n","        return a + b;\n","    }\n","    double add(double a, double b) {\n","        return a + b;\n","    }\n","}\n","\n","\n","\n","2. **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding):**\n","\n"," - Achieved through method overriding.\n","\n"," - The decision of which method to call is made at runtime based on the object type.\n","\n","  - Example (Method Overriding in Java):\n","\n",">class Animal {\n","    void sound() {\n","        System.out.println(\"Animal makes a sound\");\n","    }\n","}\n","class Dog extends Animal {\n","    void sound() {\n","        System.out.println(\"Dog barks\");\n","    }\n","}\n","public class Test {\n","    public static void main(String[] args) {\n","        Animal a = new Dog();\n","        a.sound(); // Outputs: Dog barks\n","    }\n","}\n","\n","\n","**Key Benefits of Polymorphism:**\n","\n"," - **Code Reusability:** You can write generic code that works with objects of different types.\n","\n"," - **Scalability:** Easier to add new classes or methods without modifying existing code.\n","\n"," - **Flexibility:** Promotes loose coupling by allowing different implementations to be used interchangeably.\n","\n","\n","  - Polymorphism is a cornerstone of OOP and enables developers to design systems that are more modular, extensible, and maintainable.\n","----\n","###**8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?**\n","\n"," - The with statement in Python is used to handle resources such as files more efficiently and safely. Its primary purpose when handling files is to ensure proper resource management by automatically closing the file after its block of code is executed, even if an exception occurs. This avoids potential issues like resource leaks.\n","\n","###**Key Benefits of Using the with Statement for Files:**\n","\n","1. **Automatic Cleanup:** The file is automatically closed when the block of code under the with statement is exited, whether the exit is due to normal execution or an exception.\n","\n","\n","2. **Simplified Syntax:** Eliminates the need to explicitly call file.close().\n","\n","\n","3. **Exception Safety:** Ensures the file is closed properly even if an error occurs during file operations.\n","\n","   - Example:\n","\n","#### Using with statement\n",">with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n","    content = file.read()\n","    print(content)\n","\n","#### File is automatically closed after this block.\n","\n","**Equivalent Code Without with:**\n","\n",">file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n","try:\n","    content = file.read()\n","    print(content)\n","finally:\n","    file.close()  # Must be manually called to avoid resource leaks.\n","\n","###**The with statement provides a cleaner and more Pythonic way to manage files and other resources that require proper initialization and cleanup.**\n","-----\n","###**9. What is a constructor in Python?**\n","\n","- In Python, a constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects when they are created. The constructor method in Python is __init__(). It is automatically called when a new object of a class is created.\n","\n","**Key Points:**\n","\n"," - The constructor method is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n","\n"," - It is defined using init(self, ...) and is always the first method in a class.\n","\n"," - self refers to the instance of the class (the object).\n","\n","  - **Example:**\n","\n",">>class Person:\n","    def __init__(self, name, age):\n","        # Constructor to initialize the object with name and age\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.age = age\n","\n","    def greet(self):\n","        print(f\"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.\")\n","\n","#### Creating an object of the Person class\n",">>person1 = Person(\"Anshuli\", 25)  # Constructor is called here\n","person1.greet()  \n","#### Output: Hello, my name is Anshuli and I am 25 years old.\n","\n","----\n","###**10. What are class and static methods in Python?**\n","\n"," - In Python, methods are functions defined inside a class that operate on instances of the class. There are two types of methods: class methods and static methods. Here's a simple explanation of each:\n","\n","1. **Class Method**\n","\n"," - A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It takes cls (class) as the first argument instead of self (instance). Class methods are used to operate on the class-level data or to create alternate constructors.\n","\n","**Syntax:**\n","\n",">class MyClass:\n","    @classmethod\n","    def my_class_method(cls, arg):\n","        pass\n","\n","  - **Example:**\n","\n","class Car:\n","    brand = \"Toyota\"  # Class variable\n","\n","    def init(self, model):\n","        self.model = model\n","\n","    @classmethod\n","    def change_brand(cls, new_brand):\n","        cls.brand = new_brand\n","\n","#### Example usage\n",">print(\"Before change:\", Car.brand)\n","Car.change_brand(\"Honda\")\n","print(\"After change:\", Car.brand)\n","\n","**Explanation:**\n","\n"," - change_brand is a class method that changes the class variable brand. It works on the class (cls), not the instance.\n","\n"," - You call a class method using the class itself, not an instance of the class.\n","\n","\n","#####Output:\n","\n","    Before change: Toyota\n","    After change: Honda\n","\n","2. **Static Method**\n","\n"," - A static method is a method that doesn't take self or cls as its first argument. It behaves like a regular function but is part of the class. Static methods do not modify class or instance variables. They are used when you want to perform a task related to the class but don't need access to instance or class-level data.\n","\n","**Syntax:**\n","\n",">>class MyClass:\n","    @staticmethod\n","    def my_static_method(arg):\n","        pass\n","  - Example:\n","\n","class MathOperations:\n","    \n","    @staticmethod\n","    def add(a, b):\n","        return a + b\n","\n","    @staticmethod\n","    def multiply(a, b):\n","        return a * b\n","\n","#### Example usage\n",">>sum_result = MathOperations.add(5, 3)\n","multiply_result = MathOperations.multiply(4, 6)\n","\n",">>print(\"Sum:\", sum_result)\n","print(\"Multiply:\", multiply_result)\n","\n","**Explanation:**\n","\n"," - add and multiply are static methods because they don’t need to operate on any instance or class-level data. They just perform basic arithmetic and return the result.\n","\n"," - Static methods are called on the class itself, just like class methods, but they don’t need access to class or instance data.\n","\n","\n","#####Output:\n","    Sum: 8\n","    Multiply: 24\n","\n","###**Key Differences:**\n","\n"," - Class Method: Works with the class itself, takes cls as the first argument, and can modify class-level variables.\n","\n"," - Static Method: Doesn’t take self or cls, behaves like a normal function, and doesn’t modify instance or class-level data.\n","----\n","###**11. What is method overloading in Python?**\n","\n","##**Method Overloading in Python**\n","\n"," - Method overloading is a concept where two or more methods in a class share the same name but have different parameters. In Python, method overloading is not directly supported like in languages such as Java or C++. However, you can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or by manually handling the number and type of arguments within a single method.\n","\n","  - Example 1: **Using Default Arguments**\n","\n",">class Calculator:\n","    def multiply(self, a, b=1, c=1):\n","        return a * b * c\n","\n","#### Create an instance of the class\n",">calc = Calculator()\n","\n","#### Call the method with different numbers of arguments\n",">print(calc.multiply(5))        \n","#### Output: 5 (5 * 1 * 1)\n",">print(calc.multiply(5, 4))     \n","#### Output: 20 (5 * 4 * 1)\n",">print(calc.multiply(5, 4, 3))  \n","#### Output: 60 (5 * 4 * 3)\n","\n","   - Example 2: **Handling Overloading Using *args**\n","\n",">class Calculator:\n","    def add(self, *args):\n","        return sum(args)\n","\n","##### Create an instance of the class\n",">calc = Calculator()\n","\n","#### Call the method with different numbers of arguments\n",">print(calc.add(5, 10))             \n","##### Output: 15\n",">print(calc.add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))     \n","##### Output: 15\n",">print(calc.add(100))               \n","##### Output: 100\n","\n","\n","**Explanation**\n","\n"," - In Example 1, the method uses default values for parameters, allowing it to handle calls with different numbers of arguments.\n","\n"," - In Example 2, the *args parameter allows the method to accept any number of arguments, effectively simulating method overloading.\n","\n","\n"," - Python achieves method overloading through such flexible argument handling rather than strict method signature overloading as seen in other languages.\n","----\n","###**12. What is method overriding in OOP?**\n","\n","\n"," - Method Overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.

What is a property decorator in Python?**\n","\n"," - A property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator (@property) that allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes. This is useful for encapsulation, enabling you to add logic to getting, setting, or deleting a property while maintaining a clean interface.\n","\n","**Key Points:**\n","\n"," - @property: Converts a method into a getter method.\n","\n"," - @<property_name>.setter: Defines the setter method for a property.\n","\n"," - @<property_name>.deleter: Defines the deleter method for a property.\n","\n","  - **Example**\n","\n",">class Circle:\n","    def init(self, radius):\n","        self._radius = radius  # Private attribute\n","\n","    @property\n","    def radius(self):\n","        \"\"\"Getter for radius\"\"\"\n","        return self._radius\n","\n","    @radius.setter\n","    def radius(self, value):\n","        \"\"\"Setter for radius with validation\"\"\"\n","        if value < 0:\n","            raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative.\")\n","        self._radius = value\n","\n","    @radius.deleter\n","    def radius(self):\n","        \"\"\"Deleter for radius\"\"\"\n","        print(\"Deleting radius...\")\n","        del self._radius\n","\n","#### Usage\n",">c = Circle(5)\n","print(c.radius)  # Accessing via getter: 5\n","\n",">c.radius = 10  # Setting a new value via setter\n","print(c.radius)  # Output: 10\n","\n",">try:\n","    c.radius = -3  # Trying to set an invalid value\n","except ValueError as e:\n","    print(e)  # Output: Radius cannot be negative.\n","\n",">del c.radius  # Deletes the radius attribute\n","\n","###Output:\n","     5\n","    10\n","    Radius cannot be negative.\n","    Deleting radius...\n","\n","###**This approach maintains encapsulation while allowing you to add logic for validation or side effects transparently.**\n","---\n","###**14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?**\n","\n","##**Polymorphism in OOP**\n","\n"," - Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.

What are the advantages of OOP?**\n","\n","- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has several advantages that make it a preferred paradigm for software development. Here are the key benefits with examples:\n","\n","\n","1. **Encapsulation**\n","\n"," - Encapsulation binds data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricts direct access to some of the object's components. This improves security and modularity.\n","\n","  - Example:\n","\n",">class BankAccount:\n","    def init(self, balance):\n","        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n","\n","    def deposit(self, amount):\n","        self.__balance += amount\n","\n","    def withdraw(self, amount):\n","        if amount <= self.__balance:\n","            self.__balance -= amount\n","        else:\n","            print(\"Insufficient balance!\")\n","\n","    def get_balance(self):\n","        return self.__balance\n","\n","#### Usage\n",">account = BankAccount(1000)\n","account.deposit(500)\n","print(account.get_balance())\n","\n","    Output: 1500\n","\n","\n","2. **Inheritance**\n","\n"," - Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.\n","\n","  - Example:\n","\n",">class Animal:\n","    def sound(self):\n","        print(\"This animal makes a sound\")\n","\n",">class Dog(Animal):\n","    def sound(self):\n","        print(\"Dog barks\")\n","\n","#### Usage\n","dog = Dog()\n","dog.sound()\n","\n","    Output: Dog barks\n","\n","\n","3. **Polymorphism**\n","\n"," - Polymorphism enables one interface to be used for different types, making code more flexible and extensible.\n","\n","   - Example:\n","\n",">class Bird:\n","    def fly(self):\n","        print(\"Some birds can fly\")\n","\n",">class Sparrow(Bird):\n","    def fly(self):\n","        print(\"Sparrow flies\")\n","\n",">class Ostrich(Bird):\n","    def fly(self):\n","        print(\"Ostrich cannot fly\")\n","\n","#### Usage\n","for bird in [Sparrow(), Ostrich()]:\n","    bird.fly()\n","   \n","    Output:\n","    Sparrow flies\n","    Ostrich cannot fly\n","\n","\n","4. **Abstraction**\n","\n"," - Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features, simplifying interaction with objects.\n","\n","    - Example:\n","\n",">from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n",">class Shape(ABC):\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def area(self):\n","        pass\n","\n",">class Rectangle(Shape):\n","    def init(self, length, width):\n","        self.length = length\n","        self.width = width\n","\n","    def area(self):\n","        return self.length * self.width\n","\n","#### Usage\n","rect = Rectangle(5, 10)\n","print(rect.area())  \n","#### Output: 50\n","\n","\n","5. **Code Reusability**\n","\n"," - OOP promotes reusability through inheritance and modularity, reducing duplication and improving maintenance.\n","\n","   - Example:\n","\n",">class Vehicle:\n","    def init(self, brand):\n","        self.brand = brand\n","\n","    def show_details(self):\n","        print(f\"Brand: {self.brand}\")\n","\n",">class Car(Vehicle):\n","    def init(self, brand, model):\n","        super().init(brand)\n","        self.model = model\n","\n","    def show_details(self):\n","        super().show_details()\n","        print(f\"Model: {self.model}\")\n","\n","#### Usage\n",">car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\")\n","car.show_details()\n","    \n","    Output:\n","    Brand: Toyota\n","    Model: Camry\n","\n","\n","6. **Scalability and Maintainability**\n","\n","- OOP structures the code in a way that makes it easier to scale and maintain.\n","\n","    - Example:\n","###When adding a new type of Bird class, you don't need to modify existing code, just add a new subclass and override its methods.\n","\n","\n","###By leveraging these advantages, OOP enhances code quality, readability, and reusability, making it ideal for complex software systems.\n","\n","\n","----\n","###**17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?**\n","\n"," - The key difference between a class variable and an instance variable lies in scope, sharing, and lifecycle:\n","\n","###1. **Class Variable:**\n","\n"," - **Scope:** Shared across all instances of the class. It belongs to the class itself, not any particular object.\n","\n"," - **Use:** Used for data that should be consistent across all objects.\n","\n"," - **Declaration:** Declared inside the class but outside of any methods, and usually prefixed with the class keyword or placed at the class level.\n","\n"," - **Access:** Can be accessed using the class name or an object.\n","  - Example:\n","\n",">class Car:\n","    wheels = 4  # Class variable (common to all cars)\n","\n","    def init(self, color):\n","        self.color = color  # Instance variable (specific to each car)\n","\n","### Accessing class variable\n",">print(Car.wheels)  # Output: 4\n","\n",">car1 = Car(\"Red\")\n","car2 = Car(\"Blue\")\n","\n","### Class variable is shared\n",">print(car1.wheels)  # Output: 4\n","print(car2.wheels)  # Output: 4\n","\n","### Changing class variable\n",">Car.wheels = 6\n","print(car1.wheels)  # Output: 6\n","print(car2.wheels)  # Output: 6\n","\n","\n","##2. **Instance Variable:**\n","\n","- **Scope:** Unique to each instance of the class.

Explain the purpose of \"__str__'and'__repr__\"methods in Python.**\n","\n"," - In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are two special methods used to define how objects are represented as strings.\n","\n","1. **__str__ Method:**\n","\n"," - The __str__ method is intended to provide a \"user-friendly\" or readable string representation of an object. This string is what will be displayed when the object is passed to the print() function or str() is called on it.\n","\n"," - It is meant for the end-user and should be easy to understand.\n","\n"," - If not defined, Python uses a default implementation that typically includes the object’s memory address.\n","\n","\n"," - Example:\n","\n",">class Person:\n","    def __init__(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.age = age\n","\n","    def __str__(self):\n","        return f'{self.name}, {self.age} years old'\n","\n",">p = Person('Anshuli', 25)\n","print(p)  # Output: Anshuli, 25 years old\n","\n","\n","2. **__repr__ Method:**\n","\n"," - The repr method is meant to provide a more precise or unambiguous string representation of an object, which is useful for debugging and development.\n","\n"," - The goal of repr is to return a string that, when passed to eval(), would ideally recreate the object. If this is not feasible, it should return a detailed string representation of the object.\n","\n"," - This method is called when you invoke repr() on the object or interact with the object in the interpreter.\n","\n","  - Example:\n","\n",">class Person:\n","    def init(self, name, age):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.age = age\n","\n","    def repr(self):\n","        return f'Person(\"{self.name}\", {self.age})'\n","\n",">p = Person('Anshuli', 25)\n","print(repr(p))  # Output: Person(\"Anshuli\", 25)\n","\n","\n","\n","**In summary:**\n","\n"," - str is used for creating a user-friendly representation of the object.\n","\n"," - repr is used for creating a detailed and unambiguous representation, mainly for debugging.\n","----\n","###**20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?**\n","\n"," - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent or superclass within a subclass. It allows you to invoke a method from a parent class without explicitly naming it. This is especially useful in cases of inheritance, where a subclass extends the functionality of its parent class and may override certain methods.\n","\n","**Key points about super():**\n","\n"," - 1. **Access Parent Class Methods:** It allows you to call the methods of a parent class without explicitly referencing the parent class by name.\n","\n","\n"," - 2. **Constructor Call:** It is commonly used in the init method to call the constructor of a parent class, ensuring proper initialization of both parent and child class attributes.\n","\n","\n"," - 3. **Avoids Redundant Code:** super() helps avoid repetitive calls to the parent class, making the code more maintainable and less error-prone.\n","\n","\n"," - 4. **Multiple Inheritance:** In cases of multiple inheritance, super() ensures that methods from all the parent classes are called in a consistent order according to the method resolution order (MRO).\n","\n","  - Example:\n","\n",">class Parent:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        print(\"Parent constructor called\")\n","        \n",">class Child(Parent):\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        super().__init__()  # Calls Parent's constructor\n","        print(\"Child constructor called\")\n","\n",">child_obj = Child()\n","\n","###Output:\n","    Parent constructor called\n","    Child constructor called\n","\n","In this example, super().__init__() calls the __init__ method of the Parent class.\n","\n","----\n","###**21. What is the significance of the del method in Python?**\n","\n"," - The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as a destructor. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed, meaning when there are no more references to the object, and it is being garbage collected. This method allows the object to clean up resources, like closing files or network connections, releasing memory, or performing other necessary cleanup tasks.\n","\n"," - However, it's important to note that the exact timing of when __del__ is called is not guaranteed. The garbage collector may decide when to delete the object, and if there are circular references or other complexities, it could lead to the method not being called immediately.\n","\n","Here’s a basic example:\n","\n",">class MyClass:\n","    def __del__(self):\n","        print(\"Destructor called, object is being deleted.\")\n","\n",">obj = MyClass()\n","del obj  # Explicitly calling del will trigger the __del__ method\n","\n"," ###In most cases, it's better to use context managers (with statement) for resource management, as they provide more predictable behavior compared to relying on __del__.\n","\n","----\n","###**22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?**\n","\n"," - In Python, both @staticmethod and @classmethod are used to define methods that are not bound to an instance of the class. However, they have key differences:\n","\n","##1. **@staticmethod:**\n","\n"," - It is used to define a method that does not take a reference to the instance (self) or the class (cls) as the first argument.\n","\n"," - It behaves like a normal function but belongs to the class's namespace.\n","\n"," - It cannot modify or access instance or class attributes.\n","\n","\n","  - Example:\n","\n",">class MyClass:\n","    @staticmethod\n","    def greet(name):\n","        return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","\n",">print(MyClass.greet(\"Anshuli\"))  # Output: Hello, Anshuli!\n","\n","\n","##2. **@classmethod:**\n","\n","- It is used to define a method that takes the class (cls) as the first argument, allowing it to modify class-level attributes or create instances of the class.\n","\n","- It can access or modify the class state, but not instance-specific data (unless passed explicitly).\n","\n","   - Example:\n","\n",">class MyClass:\n","    count = 0\n","\n","    def __init__(self, name):\n","        self.name = name\n","        MyClass.count += 1\n","\n","    @classmethod\n","    def get_count(cls):\n","        return cls.count\n","\n",">obj1 = MyClass(\"Anshuli\")\n","obj2 = MyClass(\"Ankita\")\n","print(MyClass.get_count())  # Output: 2\n","\n","\n","\n","**Key Differences:**\n","\n"," - @staticmethod does not take self or cls as an argument.\n","\n"," - @classmethod takes cls as the first argument and can access\n"," class-level variables.\n","\n","----\n","\n","###**23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?**\n","\n","##**Polymorphism in Python with Inheritance:**\n","\n"," - Polymorphism means \"many forms,\" and in Python, it refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method in a way that is specific to their own class.\n","\n"," - In the context of inheritance, polymorphism allows child classes to provide their own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.\n","\n","  - Example:\n","\n",">class Animal:\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Animal speaks\")\n","\n",">class Dog(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Dog barks\")\n","\n",">class Cat(Animal):\n","    def speak(self):\n","        print(\"Cat meows\")\n","\n","### Creating objects of Dog and Cat\n",">dog = Dog()\n","cat = Cat()\n","\n","### Both objects use the same method name but behave differently\n",">dog.speak()  # Output: Dog barks\n","cat.speak()  # Output: Cat meows\n","\n","----\n","\n","###**24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?**\n","\n","**Method Chaining in Python OOP:**\n","\n"," - Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line of code. It is possible if each method returns the object itself (usually self), allowing you to \"chain\" multiple method calls.\n","\n","  - Example:\n","\n",">class Calculator:\n","    def init(self, value):\n","        self.value = value\n","\n","    def add(self, num):\n","        self.value += num\n","        return self  # Return the object itself for chaining\n","\n","    def subtract(self, num):\n","        self.value -= num\n","        return self  # Return the object itself for chaining\n","\n","    def multiply(self, num):\n","        self.value *= num\n","        return self  # Return the object itself for chaining\n","\n","    def get_result(self):\n","        return self.value\n","\n","#### Using method chaining\n","calc = Calculator(10)\n","result = calc.add(5).subtract(2).multiply(3).get_result()\n","print(result)  # Output: 39\n","\n","----\n","\n","###**25. What is the purpose of the call method in Python?**\n","\n","##**The Purpose of __call__ Method in Python:**\n","\n"," - The __call__ method allows an object of a class to be used like a function. When you call an instance of a class as if it were a function, Python will automatically invoke the __call__ method.\n","\n","   - Example:\n","\n",">class Greet:\n","    def __call__(self, name):\n","        return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n","\n","#### Creating an object of the class\n","greeting = Greet()\n","\n","#### Using the object as a function\n","print(greeting(\"Anshuli\"))  # Output: Hello, Anshuli!\n","\n","----"],"metadata":{"id":"AbkwYSWMYn1s"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
